If you are generating a client to an unreliable service, Enums could evolve on the service within a same version without new endpoints. In this case, the client could receive enum values that are unexpected.

To circumvent this, you can generate an `UNEXPECTED` value with option `additional-enum-type-unexpected-member`. You can customise the name of this enum with `additional-enum-type-unexpected-member-name`.

The value can be customised with `additional-enum-type-unexpected-member-string-value`.
